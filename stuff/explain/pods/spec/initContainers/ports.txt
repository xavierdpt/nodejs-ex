KIND:     Pod
VERSION:  v1

RESOURCE: ports <[]Object>

DESCRIPTION:
     List of ports to expose from the container. Exposing a port here gives the
     system additional information about the network connections a container
     uses, but is primarily informational. Not specifying a port here DOES NOT
     prevent that port from being exposed. Any port which is listening on the
     default "0.0.0.0" address inside a container will be accessible from the
     network. Cannot be updated.

     ContainerPort represents a network port in a single container.

FIELDS:
   containerPort	<integer> -required-
     Number of port to expose on the pod's IP address. This must be a valid port
     number, 0 < x < 65536.

   hostIP	<string>
     What host IP to bind the external port to.

   hostPort	<integer>
     Number of port to expose on the host. If specified, this must be a valid
     port number, 0 < x < 65536. If HostNetwork is specified, this must match
     ContainerPort. Most containers do not need this.

   name	<string>
     If specified, this must be an IANA_SVC_NAME and unique within the pod. Each
     named port in a pod must have a unique name. Name for the port that can be
     referred to by services.

   protocol	<string>
     Protocol for port. Must be UDP or TCP. Defaults to "TCP".
