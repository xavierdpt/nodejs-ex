RESOURCE: preStop <Object>

DESCRIPTION:
     PreStop is called immediately before a container is terminated. The
     container is terminated after the handler completes. The reason for
     termination is passed to the handler. Regardless of the outcome of the
     handler, the container is eventually terminated. Other management of the
     container blocks until the hook completes. More info:
