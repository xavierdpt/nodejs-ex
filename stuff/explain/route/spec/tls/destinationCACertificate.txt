KIND:     Route
VERSION:  route.openshift.io/v1

FIELD:    destinationCACertificate <string>

DESCRIPTION:
     destinationCACertificate provides the contents of the ca certificate of the
     final destination. When using reencrypt termination this file should be
     provided in order to have routers use it for health checks on the secure
     connection. If this field is not specified, the router may provide its own
     destination CA and perform hostname validation using the short service name
     (service.namespace.svc), which allows infrastructure generated certificates
     to automatically verify.
