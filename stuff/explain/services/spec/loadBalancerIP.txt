VERSION:  v1

FIELD:    loadBalancerIP <string>

DESCRIPTION:
     Only applies to Service Type: LoadBalancer LoadBalancer will get created
     with the IP specified in this field. This feature depends on whether the
     underlying cloud-provider supports specifying the loadBalancerIP when a
     load balancer is created. This field will be ignored if the cloud-provider
     does not support the feature.
