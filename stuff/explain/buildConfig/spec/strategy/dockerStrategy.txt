KIND:     BuildConfig
VERSION:  build.openshift.io/v1

RESOURCE: dockerStrategy <Object>

DESCRIPTION:
     dockerStrategy holds the parameters to the Docker build strategy.

     DockerBuildStrategy defines input parameters specific to Docker build.

FIELDS:
   buildArgs	<[]Object>
     buildArgs contains build arguments that will be resolved in the Dockerfile.
     See https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/builder/#/arg for more
     details.

   dockerfilePath	<string>
     dockerfilePath is the path of the Dockerfile that will be used to build the
     Docker image, relative to the root of the context (contextDir).

   env	<[]Object>
     env contains additional environment variables you want to pass into a
     builder container.

   forcePull	<boolean>
     forcePull describes if the builder should pull the images from registry
     prior to building.

   from	<Object>
     from is reference to an DockerImage, ImageStreamTag, or ImageStreamImage
     from which the docker image should be pulled the resulting image will be
     used in the FROM line of the Dockerfile for this build.

   imageOptimizationPolicy	<string>
     imageOptimizationPolicy describes what optimizations the system can use
     when building images to reduce the final size or time spent building the
     image. The default policy is 'None' which means the final build image will
     be equivalent to an image created by the Docker build API. The experimental
     policy 'SkipLayers' will avoid commiting new layers in between each image
     step, and will fail if the Dockerfile cannot provide compatibility with the
     'None' policy. An additional experimental policy 'SkipLayersAndWarn' is the
     same as 'SkipLayers' but simply warns if compatibility cannot be preserved.

   noCache	<boolean>
     noCache if set to true indicates that the docker build must be executed
     with the --no-cache=true flag

   pullSecret	<Object>
     pullSecret is the name of a Secret that would be used for setting up the
     authentication for pulling the Docker images from the private Docker
     registries
