KIND:     ImageStream
VERSION:  image.openshift.io/v1

RESOURCE: lookupPolicy <Object>

DESCRIPTION:
     lookupPolicy controls how other resources reference images within this
     namespace.

     ImageLookupPolicy describes how an image stream can be used to override the
     image references used by pods, builds, and other resources in a namespace.

FIELDS:
   local	<boolean> -required-
     local will change the docker short image references (like "mysql" or
     "php:latest") on objects in this namespace to the image ID whenever they
     match this image stream, instead of reaching out to a remote registry. The
     name will be fully qualified to an image ID if found. The tag's
     referencePolicy is taken into account on the replaced value. Only works
     within the current namespace.
