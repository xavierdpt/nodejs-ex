KIND:     DeploymentConfig
VERSION:  apps.openshift.io/v1

FIELD:    test <boolean>

DESCRIPTION:
     Test ensures that this deployment config will have zero replicas except
     while a deployment is running. This allows the deployment config to be used
     as a continuous deployment test - triggering on images, running the
     deployment, and then succeeding or failing. Post strategy hooks and After
     actions can be used to integrate successful deployment with an action.
