KIND:     ImageStream
VERSION:  image.openshift.io/v1

RESOURCE: tags <[]Object>

DESCRIPTION:
     tags map arbitrary string values to specific image locators

     TagReference specifies optional annotations for images using this tag and
     an optional reference to an ImageStreamTag, ImageStreamImage, or
     DockerImage this tag should track.

FIELDS:
   annotations	<map[string]string>
     Optional; if specified, annotations that are applied to images retrieved
     via ImageStreamTags.

   from	<Object>
     Optional; if specified, a reference to another image that this tag should
     point to. Valid values are ImageStreamTag, ImageStreamImage, and
     DockerImage. ImageStreamTag references can only reference a tag within this
     same ImageStream.

   generation	<integer>
     Generation is a counter that tracks mutations to the spec tag (user
     intent). When a tag reference is changed the generation is set to match the
     current stream generation (which is incremented every time spec is
     changed). Other processes in the system like the image importer observe
     that the generation of spec tag is newer than the generation recorded in
     the status and use that as a trigger to import the newest remote tag. To
     trigger a new import, clients may set this value to zero which will reset
     the generation to the latest stream generation. Legacy clients will send
     this value as nil which will be merged with the current tag generation.

   importPolicy	<Object>
     ImportPolicy is information that controls how images may be imported by the
     server.

   name	<string> -required-
     Name of the tag

   reference	<boolean>
     Reference states if the tag will be imported. Default value is false, which
     means the tag will be imported.

   referencePolicy	<Object>
     ReferencePolicy defines how other components should consume the image.
