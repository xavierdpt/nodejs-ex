FIELD:    generation <integer>

DESCRIPTION:
     Generation is a counter that tracks mutations to the spec tag (user
     intent). When a tag reference is changed the generation is set to match the
     current stream generation (which is incremented every time spec is
     changed). Other processes in the system like the image importer observe
     that the generation of spec tag is newer than the generation recorded in
     the status and use that as a trigger to import the newest remote tag. To
     trigger a new import, clients may set this value to zero which will reset
     the generation to the latest stream generation. Legacy clients will send
     this value as nil which will be merged with the current tag generation.
