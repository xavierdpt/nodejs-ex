RESOURCE: paths <[]Object>

DESCRIPTION:
     paths is a list of source and destination paths to copy from the image.
     This content will be copied into the build context prior to starting the
     build. If no paths are set, the build context will not be altered.

     ImageSourcePath describes a path to be copied from a source image and its
     destination within the build directory.

FIELDS:
   destinationDir	<string> -required-
     destinationDir is the relative directory within the build directory where
     files copied from the image are placed.

   sourcePath	<string> -required-
     sourcePath is the absolute path of the file or directory inside the image
     to copy to the build directory. If the source path ends in /. then the
     content of the directory will be copied, but the directory itself will not
     be created at the destination.
