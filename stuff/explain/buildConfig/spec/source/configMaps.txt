KIND:     BuildConfig
VERSION:  build.openshift.io/v1

RESOURCE: configMaps <[]Object>

DESCRIPTION:
     configMaps represents a list of configMaps and their destinations that will
     be used for the build.

     ConfigMapBuildSource describes a configmap and its destination directory
     that will be used only at the build time. The content of the configmap
     referenced here will be copied into the destination directory instead of
     mounting.

FIELDS:
   configMap	<Object> -required-
     configMap is a reference to an existing configmap that you want to use in
     your build.

   destinationDir	<string>
     destinationDir is the directory where the files from the configmap should
     be available for the build time. For the Source build strategy, these will
     be injected into a container where the assemble script runs. For the Docker
     build strategy, these will be copied into the build directory, where the
     Dockerfile is located, so users can ADD or COPY them during docker build.
