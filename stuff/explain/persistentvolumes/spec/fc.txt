RESOURCE: fc <Object>

DESCRIPTION:
     FC represents a Fibre Channel resource that is attached to a kubelet's host
     machine and then exposed to the pod.

     Represents a Fibre Channel volume. Fibre Channel volumes can only be
     mounted as read/write once. Fibre Channel volumes support ownership
     management and SELinux relabeling.

FIELDS:
   fsType	<string>
     Filesystem type to mount. Must be a filesystem type supported by the host
     operating system. Ex. "ext4", "xfs", "ntfs". Implicitly inferred to be
     "ext4" if unspecified.

   lun	<integer>
     Optional: FC target lun number

   readOnly	<boolean>
     Optional: Defaults to false (read/write). ReadOnly here will force the
     ReadOnly setting in VolumeMounts.

   targetWWNs	<[]string>
     Optional: FC target worldwide names (WWNs)

   wwids	<[]string>
     Optional: FC volume world wide identifiers (wwids) Either wwids or
     combination of targetWWNs and lun must be set, but not both simultaneously.
