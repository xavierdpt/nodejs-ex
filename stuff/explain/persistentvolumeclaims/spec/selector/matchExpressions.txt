DESCRIPTION:
     matchExpressions is a list of label selector requirements. The requirements
     are ANDed.

     A label selector requirement is a selector that contains values, a key, and
     an operator that relates the key and values.

FIELDS:
   key	<string> -required-
     key is the label key that the selector applies to.

   operator	<string> -required-
     operator represents a key's relationship to a set of values. Valid
     operators are In, NotIn, Exists and DoesNotExist.

   values	<[]string>
     values is an array of string values. If the operator is In or NotIn, the
     values array must be non-empty. If the operator is Exists or DoesNotExist,
     the values array must be empty. This array is replaced during a strategic
     merge patch.
