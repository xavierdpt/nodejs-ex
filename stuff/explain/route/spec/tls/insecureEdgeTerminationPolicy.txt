FIELD:    insecureEdgeTerminationPolicy <string>

DESCRIPTION:
     insecureEdgeTerminationPolicy indicates the desired behavior for insecure
     connections to a route. While each router may make its own decisions on
     which ports to expose, this is normally port 80. * Allow - traffic is sent
     to the server on the insecure port (default) * Disable - no traffic is
     allowed on the insecure port. * Redirect - clients are redirected to the
     secure port.
