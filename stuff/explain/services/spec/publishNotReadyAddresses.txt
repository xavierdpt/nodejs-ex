KIND:     Service
VERSION:  v1

FIELD:    publishNotReadyAddresses <boolean>

DESCRIPTION:
     publishNotReadyAddresses, when set to true, indicates that DNS
     implementations must publish the notReadyAddresses of subsets for the
     Endpoints associated with the Service. The default value is false. The
     primary use case for setting this field is to use a StatefulSet's Headless
     Service to propagate SRV records for its Pods without respect to their
     readiness for purpose of peer discovery.
