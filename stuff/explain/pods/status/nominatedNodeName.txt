KIND:     Pod
VERSION:  v1

FIELD:    nominatedNodeName <string>

DESCRIPTION:
     nominatedNodeName is set only when this pod preempts other pods on the
     node, but it cannot be scheduled right away as preemption victims receive
     their graceful termination periods. This field does not guarantee that the
     pod will be scheduled on this node. Scheduler may decide to place the pod
     elsewhere if other nodes become available sooner. Scheduler may also decide
     to give the resources on this node to a higher priority pod that is created
     after preemption. As a result, this field may be different than
     PodSpec.nodeName when the pod is scheduled.
