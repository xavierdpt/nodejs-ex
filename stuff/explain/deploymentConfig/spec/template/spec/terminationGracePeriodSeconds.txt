FIELD:    terminationGracePeriodSeconds <integer>

DESCRIPTION:
     Optional duration in seconds the pod needs to terminate gracefully. May be
     decreased in delete request. Value must be non-negative integer. The value
     zero indicates delete immediately. If this value is nil, the default grace
     period will be used instead. The grace period is the duration in seconds
     after the processes running in the pod are sent a termination signal and
     the time when the processes are forcibly halted with a kill signal. Set
     this value longer than the expected cleanup time for your process. Defaults
     to 30 seconds.
