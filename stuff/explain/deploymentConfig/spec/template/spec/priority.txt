FIELD:    priority <integer>

DESCRIPTION:
     The priority value. Various system components use this field to find the
     priority of the pod. When Priority Admission Controller is enabled, it
     prevents users from setting this field. The admission controller populates
     this field from PriorityClassName. The higher the value, the higher the
     priority.
