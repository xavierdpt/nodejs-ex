KIND:     Service
VERSION:  v1

FIELD:    clusterIP <string>

DESCRIPTION:
     clusterIP is the IP address of the service and is usually assigned randomly
     by the master. If an address is specified manually and is not in use by
     others, it will be allocated to the service; otherwise, creation of the
     service will fail. This field can not be changed through updates. Valid
     values are "None", empty string (""), or a valid IP address. "None" can be
     specified for headless services when proxying is not required. Only applies
     to types ClusterIP, NodePort, and LoadBalancer. Ignored if type is
     ExternalName. More info:
