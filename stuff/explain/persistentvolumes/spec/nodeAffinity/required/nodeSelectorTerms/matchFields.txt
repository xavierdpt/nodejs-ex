DESCRIPTION:
     A list of node selector requirements by node's fields.

     A node selector requirement is a selector that contains values, a key, and
     an operator that relates the key and values.

FIELDS:
   key	<string> -required-
     The label key that the selector applies to.

   operator	<string> -required-
     Represents a key's relationship to a set of values. Valid operators are In,
     NotIn, Exists, DoesNotExist. Gt, and Lt.

   values	<[]string>
     An array of string values. If the operator is In or NotIn, the values array
     must be non-empty. If the operator is Exists or DoesNotExist, the values
     array must be empty. If the operator is Gt or Lt, the values array must
     have a single element, which will be interpreted as an integer. This array
     is replaced during a strategic merge patch.
