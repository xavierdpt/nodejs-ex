RESOURCE: triggers <[]Object>

DESCRIPTION:
     Triggers determine how updates to a DeploymentConfig result in new
     deployments. If no triggers are defined, a new deployment can only occur as
     a result of an explicit client update to the DeploymentConfig with a new
     LatestVersion. If null, defaults to having a config change trigger.

     DeploymentTriggerPolicy describes a policy for a single trigger that
     results in a new deployment.

FIELDS:

     ImageChangeParams represents the parameters for the ImageChange trigger.
