     Security options the pod should run with. More info:

     SecurityContext holds security configuration that will be applied to a
     container. Some fields are present in both SecurityContext and
     PodSecurityContext. When both are set, the values in SecurityContext take
     precedence.

FIELDS:
   allowPrivilegeEscalation	<boolean>
     AllowPrivilegeEscalation controls whether a process can gain more
     privileges than its parent process. This bool directly controls if the
     no_new_privs flag will be set on the container process.
     AllowPrivilegeEscalation is true always when the container is: 1) run as
     Privileged 2) has CAP_SYS_ADMIN

   capabilities	<Object>
     The capabilities to add/drop when running containers. Defaults to the
     default set of capabilities granted by the container runtime.

   privileged	<boolean>
     Run container in privileged mode. Processes in privileged containers are
     essentially equivalent to root on the host. Defaults to false.

   readOnlyRootFilesystem	<boolean>
     Whether this container has a read-only root filesystem. Default is false.

   runAsGroup	<integer>
     The GID to run the entrypoint of the container process. Uses runtime
     default if unset. May also be set in PodSecurityContext. If set in both
     SecurityContext and PodSecurityContext, the value specified in
     SecurityContext takes precedence.

   runAsNonRoot	<boolean>
     Indicates that the container must run as a non-root user. If true, the
     Kubelet will validate the image at runtime to ensure that it does not run
     as UID 0 (root) and fail to start the container if it does. If unset or
     false, no such validation will be performed. May also be set in
     PodSecurityContext. If set in both SecurityContext and PodSecurityContext,
     the value specified in SecurityContext takes precedence.

   runAsUser	<integer>
     The UID to run the entrypoint of the container process. Defaults to user
     specified in image metadata if unspecified. May also be set in
     PodSecurityContext. If set in both SecurityContext and PodSecurityContext,
     the value specified in SecurityContext takes precedence.

   seLinuxOptions	<Object>
     The SELinux context to be applied to the container. If unspecified, the
     container runtime will allocate a random SELinux context for each
     container. May also be set in PodSecurityContext. If set in both
     SecurityContext and PodSecurityContext, the value specified in
     SecurityContext takes precedence.
