KIND:     BuildConfig
VERSION:  build.openshift.io/v1

FIELD:    as <[]string>

DESCRIPTION:
     A list of image names that this source will be used in place of during a
     multi-stage Docker image build. For instance, a Dockerfile that uses "COPY
     --from=nginx:latest" will first check for an image source that has
     "nginx:latest" in this field before attempting to pull directly. If the
     Dockerfile does not reference an image source it is ignored. This field and
     paths may both be set, in which case the contents will be used twice.
