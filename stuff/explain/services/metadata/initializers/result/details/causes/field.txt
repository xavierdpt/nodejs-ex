FIELD:    field <string>

DESCRIPTION:
     The field of the resource that has caused this error, as named by its JSON
     serialization. May include dot and postfix notation for nested attributes.
     Arrays are zero-indexed. Fields may appear more than once in an array of
     causes due to fields having multiple errors. Optional. Examples: "name" -
     the field "name" on the current resource "items[0].name" - the field "name"
     on the first array entry in "items"
