KIND:     PersistentVolume
VERSION:  v1

FIELD:    path <string>

DESCRIPTION:
     The full path to the volume on the node. It can be either a directory or
     block device (disk, partition, ...). Directories can be represented only by
     PersistentVolume with VolumeMode=Filesystem. Block devices can be
     represented only by VolumeMode=Block, which also requires the BlockVolume
     alpha feature gate to be enabled.
