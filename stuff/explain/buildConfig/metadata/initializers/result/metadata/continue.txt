KIND:     BuildConfig
VERSION:  build.openshift.io/v1

FIELD:    continue <string>

DESCRIPTION:
     continue may be set if the user set a limit on the number of items
     returned, and indicates that the server has more data available. The value
     is opaque and may be used to issue another request to the endpoint that
     served this list to retrieve the next set of available objects. Continuing
     a list may not be possible if the server configuration has changed or more
     than a few minutes have passed. The resourceVersion field returned when
     using this continue value will be identical to the value in the first
     response.
