KIND:     BuildConfig
VERSION:  build.openshift.io/v1

RESOURCE: buildArgs <[]Object>

DESCRIPTION:
     buildArgs contains build arguments that will be resolved in the Dockerfile.
     See https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/builder/#/arg for more
     details.

     EnvVar represents an environment variable present in a Container.

FIELDS:
   name	<string> -required-
     Name of the environment variable. Must be a C_IDENTIFIER.

   value	<string>
     Variable references $(VAR_NAME) are expanded using the previous defined
     environment variables in the container and any service environment
     variables. If a variable cannot be resolved, the reference in the input
     string will be unchanged. The $(VAR_NAME) syntax can be escaped with a
     double $$, ie: $$(VAR_NAME). Escaped references will never be expanded,
     regardless of whether the variable exists or not. Defaults to "".

   valueFrom	<Object>
     Source for the environment variable's value. Cannot be used if value is not
     empty.
