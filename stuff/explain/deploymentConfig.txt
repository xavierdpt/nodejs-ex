KIND:     DeploymentConfig
VERSION:  apps.openshift.io/v1

DESCRIPTION:
     Deployment Configs define the template for a pod and manages deploying new
     images or configuration changes. A single deployment configuration is
     usually analogous to a single micro-service. Can support many different
     deployment patterns, including full restart, customizable rolling updates,
     and fully custom behaviors, as well as pre- and post- deployment hooks.
     Each individual deployment is represented as a replication controller. A
     deployment is "triggered" when its configuration is changed or a tag in an
     Image Stream is changed. Triggers can be disabled to allow manual control
     over a deployment. The "strategy" determines how the deployment is carried
     out and may be changed at any time. The `latestVersion` field is updated
     when a new deployment is triggered by any means.

FIELDS:
   apiVersion	<string>
     APIVersion defines the versioned schema of this representation of an
