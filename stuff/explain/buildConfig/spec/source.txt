KIND:     BuildConfig
VERSION:  build.openshift.io/v1

RESOURCE: source <Object>

DESCRIPTION:
     source describes the SCM in use.

     BuildSource is the SCM used for the build.

FIELDS:
   binary	<Object>
     binary builds accept a binary as their input. The binary is generally
     assumed to be a tar, gzipped tar, or zip file depending on the strategy.
     For Docker builds, this is the build context and an optional Dockerfile may
     be specified to override any Dockerfile in the build context. For Source
     builds, this is assumed to be an archive as described above. For Source and
     Docker builds, if binary.asFile is set the build will receive a directory
     with a single file. contextDir may be used when an archive is provided.
     Custom builds will receive this binary as input on STDIN.

   configMaps	<[]Object>
     configMaps represents a list of configMaps and their destinations that will
     be used for the build.

   contextDir	<string>
     contextDir specifies the sub-directory where the source code for the
     application exists. This allows to have buildable sources in directory
     other than root of repository.

   dockerfile	<string>
     dockerfile is the raw contents of a Dockerfile which should be built. When
     this option is specified, the FROM may be modified based on your strategy
     base image and additional ENV stanzas from your strategy environment will
     be added after the FROM, but before the rest of your Dockerfile stanzas.
     The Dockerfile source type may be used with other options like git - in
     those cases the Git repo will have any innate Dockerfile replaced in the
     context dir.

   git	<Object>
     git contains optional information about git build source

   images	<[]Object>
     images describes a set of images to be used to provide source for the build

   secrets	<[]Object>
     secrets represents a list of secrets and their destinations that will be
     used only for the build.

   sourceSecret	<Object>
     sourceSecret is the name of a Secret that would be used for setting up the
     authentication for cloning private repository. The secret contains valid
     credentials for remote repository, where the data's key represent the
     authentication method to be used and value is the base64 encoded
     credentials. Supported auth methods are: ssh-privatekey.

   type	<string> -required-
     type of build input to accept
