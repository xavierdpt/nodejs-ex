FIELD:    fieldPath <string>

DESCRIPTION:
     If referring to a piece of an object instead of an entire object, this
     string should contain a valid JSON/Go field access statement, such as
     desiredState.manifest.containers[2]. For example, if the object reference
     is to a container within a pod, this would take on a value like:
     "spec.containers{name}" (where "name" refers to the name of the container
     that triggered the event) or if no container name is specified
     "spec.containers[2]" (container with index 2 in this pod). This syntax is
     chosen only to have some well-defined way of referencing a part of an
     object.
