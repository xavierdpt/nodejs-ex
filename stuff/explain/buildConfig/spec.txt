KIND:     BuildConfig
VERSION:  build.openshift.io/v1

RESOURCE: spec <Object>

DESCRIPTION:
     spec holds all the input necessary to produce a new build, and the
     conditions when to trigger them.

     BuildConfigSpec describes when and how builds are created

FIELDS:
   completionDeadlineSeconds	<integer>
     completionDeadlineSeconds is an optional duration in seconds, counted from
     the time when a build pod gets scheduled in the system, that the build may
     be active on a node before the system actively tries to terminate the
     build; value must be positive integer

   failedBuildsHistoryLimit	<integer>
     failedBuildsHistoryLimit is the number of old failed builds to retain. If
     not specified, all failed builds are retained.

   nodeSelector	<map[string]string> -required-
     nodeSelector is a selector which must be true for the build pod to fit on a
     node If nil, it can be overridden by default build nodeselector values for
     the cluster. If set to an empty map or a map with any values, default build
     nodeselector values are ignored.

   output	<Object>
     output describes the Docker image the Strategy should produce.

   postCommit	<Object>
     postCommit is a build hook executed after the build output image is
     committed, before it is pushed to a registry.

   resources	<Object>
     resources computes resource requirements to execute the build.

   revision	<Object>
     revision is the information from the source for a specific repo snapshot.
     This is optional.

   runPolicy	<string>
     RunPolicy describes how the new build created from this build configuration
     will be scheduled for execution. This is optional, if not specified we
     default to "Serial".

   serviceAccount	<string>
     serviceAccount is the name of the ServiceAccount to use to run the pod
     created by this build. The pod will be allowed to use secrets referenced by
     the ServiceAccount

   source	<Object>
     source describes the SCM in use.

   strategy	<Object> -required-
     strategy defines how to perform a build.

   successfulBuildsHistoryLimit	<integer>
     successfulBuildsHistoryLimit is the number of old successful builds to
     retain. If not specified, all successful builds are retained.

   triggers	<[]Object> -required-
     triggers determine how new Builds can be launched from a BuildConfig. If no
     triggers are defined, a new build can only occur as a result of an explicit
     client build creation.
