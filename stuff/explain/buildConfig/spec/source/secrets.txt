KIND:     BuildConfig
VERSION:  build.openshift.io/v1

RESOURCE: secrets <[]Object>

DESCRIPTION:
     secrets represents a list of secrets and their destinations that will be
     used only for the build.

     SecretBuildSource describes a secret and its destination directory that
     will be used only at the build time. The content of the secret referenced
     here will be copied into the destination directory instead of mounting.

FIELDS:
   destinationDir	<string>
     destinationDir is the directory where the files from the secret should be
     available for the build time. For the Source build strategy, these will be
     injected into a container where the assemble script runs. Later, when the
     script finishes, all files injected will be truncated to zero length. For
     the Docker build strategy, these will be copied into the build directory,
     where the Dockerfile is located, so users can ADD or COPY them during
     docker build.

   secret	<Object> -required-
     secret is a reference to an existing secret that you want to use in your
     build.
