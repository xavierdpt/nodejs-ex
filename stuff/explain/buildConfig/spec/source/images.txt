RESOURCE: images <[]Object>

DESCRIPTION:
     images describes a set of images to be used to provide source for the build

     ImageSource is used to describe build source that will be extracted from an
     image or used during a multi stage build. A reference of type
     ImageStreamTag, ImageStreamImage or DockerImage may be used. A pull secret
     can be specified to pull the image from an external registry or override
     the default service account secret if pulling from the internal registry.
     Image sources can either be used to extract content from an image and place
     it into the build context along with the repository source, or used
     directly during a multi-stage Docker build to allow content to be copied
     without overwriting the contents of the repository source (see the 'paths'
     and 'as' fields).

FIELDS:
   as	<[]string>
     A list of image names that this source will be used in place of during a
     multi-stage Docker image build. For instance, a Dockerfile that uses "COPY
     --from=nginx:latest" will first check for an image source that has
     "nginx:latest" in this field before attempting to pull directly. If the
     Dockerfile does not reference an image source it is ignored. This field and
     paths may both be set, in which case the contents will be used twice.

   from	<Object> -required-
     from is a reference to an ImageStreamTag, ImageStreamImage, or DockerImage
     to copy source from.

   paths	<[]Object>
     paths is a list of source and destination paths to copy from the image.
     This content will be copied into the build context prior to starting the
     build. If no paths are set, the build context will not be altered.

   pullSecret	<Object>
     pullSecret is a reference to a secret to be used to pull the image from a
     registry If the image is pulled from the OpenShift registry, this field
     does not need to be set.
