KIND:     BuildConfig
VERSION:  build.openshift.io/v1

FIELD:    asFile <string>

DESCRIPTION:
     asFile indicates that the provided binary input should be considered a
     single file within the build input. For example, specifying "webapp.war"
     would place the provided binary as `/webapp.war` for the builder. If left
     empty, the Docker and Source build strategies assume this file is a zip,
     tar, or tar.gz file and extract it as the source. The custom strategy
     receives this binary as standard input. This filename may not contain
     slashes or be '..' or '.'.
