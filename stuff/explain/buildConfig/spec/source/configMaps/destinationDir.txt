KIND:     BuildConfig
VERSION:  build.openshift.io/v1

FIELD:    destinationDir <string>

DESCRIPTION:
     destinationDir is the directory where the files from the configmap should
     be available for the build time. For the Source build strategy, these will
     be injected into a container where the assemble script runs. For the Docker
     build strategy, these will be copied into the build directory, where the
     Dockerfile is located, so users can ADD or COPY them during docker build.
