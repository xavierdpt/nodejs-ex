FIELD:    externalIPs <[]string>

DESCRIPTION:
     externalIPs is a list of IP addresses for which nodes in the cluster will
     also accept traffic for this service. These IPs are not managed by
     Kubernetes. The user is responsible for ensuring that traffic arrives at a
     node with this IP. A common example is external load-balancers that are not
     part of the Kubernetes system.
