KIND:     Pod
VERSION:  v1

RESOURCE: requiredDuringSchedulingIgnoredDuringExecution <[]Object>

DESCRIPTION:
     If the affinity requirements specified by this field are not met at
     scheduling time, the pod will not be scheduled onto the node. If the
     affinity requirements specified by this field cease to be met at some point
     during pod execution (e.g. due to a pod label update), the system may or
     may not try to eventually evict the pod from its node. When there are
     multiple elements, the lists of nodes corresponding to each podAffinityTerm
     are intersected, i.e. all terms must be satisfied.

     Defines a set of pods (namely those matching the labelSelector relative to
     the given namespace(s)) that this pod should be co-located (affinity) or
     not co-located (anti-affinity) with, where co-located is defined as running
     on a node whose value of the label with key <topologyKey> matches that of
     any node on which a pod of the set of pods is running

FIELDS:
   labelSelector	<Object>
     A label query over a set of resources, in this case pods.

   namespaces	<[]string>
     namespaces specifies which namespaces the labelSelector applies to (matches
     against); null or empty list means "this pod's namespace"

   topologyKey	<string> -required-
     This pod should be co-located (affinity) or not co-located (anti-affinity)
     with the pods matching the labelSelector in the specified namespaces, where
     co-located is defined as running on a node whose value of the label with
     key topologyKey matches that of any node on which any of the selected pods
     is running. Empty topologyKey is not allowed.
