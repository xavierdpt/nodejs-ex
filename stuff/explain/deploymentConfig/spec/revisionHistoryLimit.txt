FIELD:    revisionHistoryLimit <integer>

DESCRIPTION:
     RevisionHistoryLimit is the number of old ReplicationControllers to retain
     to allow for rollbacks. This field is a pointer to allow for

     (This only applies to DeploymentConfigs created via the new group API
     resource, not the legacy resource.)
