KIND:     BuildConfig
VERSION:  build.openshift.io/v1

RESOURCE: from <Object>

DESCRIPTION:
     from is reference to an DockerImage, ImageStreamTag, or ImageStreamImage
     from which the docker image should be pulled the resulting image will be
     used in the FROM line of the Dockerfile for this build.

     ObjectReference contains enough information to let you inspect or modify
     the referred object.

FIELDS:
   apiVersion	<string>
     API version of the referent.

   fieldPath	<string>
     If referring to a piece of an object instead of an entire object, this
     string should contain a valid JSON/Go field access statement, such as
     desiredState.manifest.containers[2]. For example, if the object reference
     is to a container within a pod, this would take on a value like:
     "spec.containers{name}" (where "name" refers to the name of the container
     that triggered the event) or if no container name is specified
     "spec.containers[2]" (container with index 2 in this pod). This syntax is
     chosen only to have some well-defined way of referencing a part of an
     object.
