RESOURCE: initializers <Object>

DESCRIPTION:
     An initializer is a controller which enforces some system invariant at
     object creation time. This field is a list of initializers that have not
     yet acted on this object. If nil or empty, this object has been completely
     initialized. Otherwise, the object is considered uninitialized and is
     hidden (in list/watch and get calls) from clients that haven't explicitly
     asked to observe uninitialized objects. When an object is created, the
     system will populate this list with the current set of initializers. Only
     privileged users may set or modify this list. Once it is empty, it may not
     be modified further by any user.

     Initializers tracks the progress of initialization.

FIELDS:
   pending	<[]Object> -required-
     Pending is a list of initializers that must execute in order before this
     object is visible. When the last pending initializer is removed, and no
     failing result is set, the initializers struct will be set to nil and the
     object is considered as initialized and visible to all clients.

   result	<Object>
     If result is set with the Failure field, the object will be persisted to
     storage and then deleted, ensuring that other clients can observe the
     deletion.
