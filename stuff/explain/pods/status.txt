KIND:     Pod
VERSION:  v1

RESOURCE: status <Object>

DESCRIPTION:
     Most recently observed status of the pod. This data may not be up to date.
     Populated by the system. Read-only. More info:
     https://git.k8s.io/community/contributors/devel/api-conventions.md#spec-and-status

     PodStatus represents information about the status of a pod. Status may
     trail the actual state of a system, especially if the node that hosts the
     pod cannot contact the control plane.

FIELDS:
   conditions	<[]Object>
     Current service state of pod. More info:
     https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/pods/pod-lifecycle#pod-conditions

   containerStatuses	<[]Object>
     The list has one entry per container in the manifest. Each entry is
     currently the output of `docker inspect`. More info:
     https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/pods/pod-lifecycle#pod-and-container-status

   hostIP	<string>
     IP address of the host to which the pod is assigned. Empty if not yet
     scheduled.

   initContainerStatuses	<[]Object>
     The list has one entry per init container in the manifest. The most recent
     successful init container will have ready = true, the most recently started
     container will have startTime set. More info:
     https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/pods/pod-lifecycle#pod-and-container-status

   message	<string>
     A human readable message indicating details about why the pod is in this
     condition.

   nominatedNodeName	<string>
     nominatedNodeName is set only when this pod preempts other pods on the
     node, but it cannot be scheduled right away as preemption victims receive
     their graceful termination periods. This field does not guarantee that the
     pod will be scheduled on this node. Scheduler may decide to place the pod
     elsewhere if other nodes become available sooner. Scheduler may also decide
     to give the resources on this node to a higher priority pod that is created
     after preemption. As a result, this field may be different than
     PodSpec.nodeName when the pod is scheduled.

   phase	<string>
     The phase of a Pod is a simple, high-level summary of where the Pod is in
     its lifecycle. The conditions array, the reason and message fields, and the
     individual container status arrays contain more detail about the pod's
     status. There are five possible phase values: Pending: The pod has been
     accepted by the Kubernetes system, but one or more of the container images
     has not been created. This includes time before being scheduled as well as
     time spent downloading images over the network, which could take a while.
     Running: The pod has been bound to a node, and all of the containers have
     been created. At least one container is still running, or is in the process
     of starting or restarting. Succeeded: All containers in the pod have
     terminated in success, and will not be restarted. Failed: All containers in
     the pod have terminated, and at least one container has terminated in
     failure. The container either exited with non-zero status or was terminated
     by the system. Unknown: For some reason the state of the pod could not be
     obtained, typically due to an error in communicating with the host of the
     pod. More info:
     https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/pods/pod-lifecycle#pod-phase

   podIP	<string>
     IP address allocated to the pod. Routable at least within the cluster.
     Empty if not yet allocated.

   qosClass	<string>
     The Quality of Service (QOS) classification assigned to the pod based on
     resource requirements See PodQOSClass type for available QOS classes More
     info:
     https://git.k8s.io/community/contributors/design-proposals/node/resource-qos.md

   reason	<string>
     A brief CamelCase message indicating details about why the pod is in this
     state. e.g. 'Evicted'

   startTime	<string>
     RFC 3339 date and time at which the object was acknowledged by the Kubelet.
     This is before the Kubelet pulled the container image(s) for the pod.
