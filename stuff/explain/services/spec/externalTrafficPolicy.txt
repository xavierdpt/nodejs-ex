KIND:     Service
VERSION:  v1

FIELD:    externalTrafficPolicy <string>

DESCRIPTION:
     externalTrafficPolicy denotes if this Service desires to route external
     traffic to node-local or cluster-wide endpoints. "Local" preserves the
     client source IP and avoids a second hop for LoadBalancer and Nodeport type
     services, but risks potentially imbalanced traffic spreading. "Cluster"
     obscures the client source IP and may cause a second hop to another node,
     but should have good overall load-spreading.
