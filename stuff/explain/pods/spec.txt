KIND:     Pod
VERSION:  v1

RESOURCE: spec <Object>

DESCRIPTION:
     Specification of the desired behavior of the pod. More info:
     https://git.k8s.io/community/contributors/devel/api-conventions.md#spec-and-status

     PodSpec is a description of a pod.

FIELDS:
   activeDeadlineSeconds	<integer>
     Optional duration in seconds the pod may be active on the node relative to
     StartTime before the system will actively try to mark it failed and kill
     associated containers. Value must be a positive integer.

   affinity	<Object>
     If specified, the pod's scheduling constraints

   automountServiceAccountToken	<boolean>
     AutomountServiceAccountToken indicates whether a service account token
     should be automatically mounted.

   containers	<[]Object> -required-
     List of containers belonging to the pod. Containers cannot currently be
     added or removed. There must be at least one container in a Pod. Cannot be
     updated.

   dnsConfig	<Object>
     Specifies the DNS parameters of a pod. Parameters specified here will be
     merged to the generated DNS configuration based on DNSPolicy.

   dnsPolicy	<string>
     Set DNS policy for the pod. Defaults to "ClusterFirst". Valid values are
     'ClusterFirstWithHostNet', 'ClusterFirst', 'Default' or 'None'. DNS
     parameters given in DNSConfig will be merged with the policy selected with
     DNSPolicy. To have DNS options set along with hostNetwork, you have to
     specify DNS policy explicitly to 'ClusterFirstWithHostNet'.

   hostAliases	<[]Object>
     HostAliases is an optional list of hosts and IPs that will be injected into
     the pod's hosts file if specified. This is only valid for non-hostNetwork
     pods.

   hostIPC	<boolean>
     Use the host's ipc namespace. Optional: Default to false.

   hostNetwork	<boolean>
     Host networking requested for this pod. Use the host's network namespace.
     If this option is set, the ports that will be used must be specified.
     Default to false.

   hostPID	<boolean>
     Use the host's pid namespace. Optional: Default to false.

   hostname	<string>
     Specifies the hostname of the Pod If not specified, the pod's hostname will
     be set to a system-defined value.

   imagePullSecrets	<[]Object>
     ImagePullSecrets is an optional list of references to secrets in the same
     namespace to use for pulling any of the images used by this PodSpec. If
     specified, these secrets will be passed to individual puller
     implementations for them to use. For example, in the case of docker, only
     DockerConfig type secrets are honored. More info:
     https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/containers/images#specifying-imagepullsecrets-on-a-pod

   initContainers	<[]Object>
     List of initialization containers belonging to the pod. Init containers are
     executed in order prior to containers being started. If any init container
     fails, the pod is considered to have failed and is handled according to its
     restartPolicy. The name for an init container or normal container must be
     unique among all containers. Init containers may not have Lifecycle
     actions, Readiness probes, or Liveness probes. The resourceRequirements of
     an init container are taken into account during scheduling by finding the
     highest request/limit for each resource type, and then using the max of of
     that value or the sum of the normal containers. Limits are applied to init
     containers in a similar fashion. Init containers cannot currently be added
     or removed. Cannot be updated. More info:
     https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/pods/init-containers/

   nodeName	<string>
     NodeName is a request to schedule this pod onto a specific node. If it is
     non-empty, the scheduler simply schedules this pod onto that node, assuming
     that it fits resource requirements.

   nodeSelector	<map[string]string>
     NodeSelector is a selector which must be true for the pod to fit on a node.
     Selector which must match a node's labels for the pod to be scheduled on
     that node. More info:
     https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/configuration/assign-pod-node/

   priority	<integer>
     The priority value. Various system components use this field to find the
     priority of the pod. When Priority Admission Controller is enabled, it
     prevents users from setting this field. The admission controller populates
     this field from PriorityClassName. The higher the value, the higher the
     priority.

   priorityClassName	<string>
     If specified, indicates the pod's priority. "system-node-critical" and
     "system-cluster-critical" are two special keywords which indicate the
     highest priorities with the former being the highest priority. Any other
     name must be defined by creating a PriorityClass object with that name. If
     not specified, the pod priority will be default or zero if there is no
     default.

   readinessGates	<[]Object>
     If specified, all readiness gates will be evaluated for pod readiness. A
     pod is ready when all its containers are ready AND all conditions specified
     in the readiness gates have status equal to "True" More info:
     https://github.com/kubernetes/community/blob/master/keps/sig-network/0007-pod-ready%2B%2B.md

   restartPolicy	<string>
     Restart policy for all containers within the pod. One of Always, OnFailure,
     Never. Default to Always. More info:
     https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/pods/pod-lifecycle/#restart-policy

   schedulerName	<string>
     If specified, the pod will be dispatched by specified scheduler. If not
     specified, the pod will be dispatched by default scheduler.

   securityContext	<Object>
     SecurityContext holds pod-level security attributes and common container
     settings. Optional: Defaults to empty. See type description for default
     values of each field.

   serviceAccount	<string>
     DeprecatedServiceAccount is a depreciated alias for ServiceAccountName.
     Deprecated: Use serviceAccountName instead.

   serviceAccountName	<string>
     ServiceAccountName is the name of the ServiceAccount to use to run this
     pod. More info:
     https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/configure-pod-container/configure-service-account/

   shareProcessNamespace	<boolean>
     Share a single process namespace between all of the containers in a pod.
     When this is set containers will be able to view and signal processes from
     other containers in the same pod, and the first process in each container
     will not be assigned PID 1. HostPID and ShareProcessNamespace cannot both
     be set. Optional: Default to false. This field is alpha-level and is
     honored only by servers that enable the PodShareProcessNamespace feature.

   subdomain	<string>
     If specified, the fully qualified Pod hostname will be
     "<hostname>.<subdomain>.<pod namespace>.svc.<cluster domain>". If not
     specified, the pod will not have a domainname at all.

   terminationGracePeriodSeconds	<integer>
     Optional duration in seconds the pod needs to terminate gracefully. May be
     decreased in delete request. Value must be non-negative integer. The value
     zero indicates delete immediately. If this value is nil, the default grace
     period will be used instead. The grace period is the duration in seconds
     after the processes running in the pod are sent a termination signal and
     the time when the processes are forcibly halted with a kill signal. Set
     this value longer than the expected cleanup time for your process. Defaults
     to 30 seconds.

   tolerations	<[]Object>
     If specified, the pod's tolerations.

   volumes	<[]Object>
     List of volumes that can be mounted by containers belonging to the pod.
     More info: https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/storage/volumes
