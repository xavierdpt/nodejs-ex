DESCRIPTION:
     If unspecified, each key-value pair in the Data field of the referenced
     ConfigMap will be projected into the volume as a file whose name is the key
     and content is the value. If specified, the listed keys will be projected
     into the specified paths, and unlisted keys will not be present. If a key
     is specified which is not present in the ConfigMap, the volume setup will
     error unless it is marked optional. Paths must be relative and may not
     contain the '..' path or start with '..'.

     Maps a string key to a path within a volume.

FIELDS:
   key	<string> -required-
     The key to project.

   mode	<integer>
     Optional: mode bits to use on this file, must be a value between 0 and
     0777. If not specified, the volume defaultMode will be used. This might be
     in conflict with other options that affect the file mode, like fsGroup, and
     the result can be other mode bits set.

   path	<string> -required-
     The relative path of the file to map the key to. May not be an absolute
     path. May not contain the path element '..'. May not start with the string
     '..'.
