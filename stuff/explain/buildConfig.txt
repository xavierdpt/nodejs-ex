KIND:     BuildConfig
VERSION:  build.openshift.io/v1

DESCRIPTION:
     Build configurations define a build process for new Docker images. There
     are three types of builds possible - a Docker build using a Dockerfile, a
     Source-to-Image build that uses a specially prepared base image that
     accepts source code that it can make runnable, and a custom build that can
     run // arbitrary Docker images as a base and accept the build parameters.
     Builds run on the cluster and on completion are pushed to the Docker
     registry specified in the "output" section. A build can be triggered via a
     webhook, when the base image changes, or when a user manually requests a
     new build be // created. Each build created by a build configuration is
     numbered and refers back to its parent configuration. Multiple builds can
     be triggered at once. Builds that do not have "output" set can be used to
     test code or run a verification build.

FIELDS:
   apiVersion	<string>
     APIVersion defines the versioned schema of this representation of an
     object. Servers should convert recognized schemas to the latest internal
     value, and may reject unrecognized values. More info:
     https://git.k8s.io/community/contributors/devel/api-conventions.md#resources

   kind	<string>
     Kind is a string value representing the REST resource this object
     represents. Servers may infer this from the endpoint the client submits
     requests to. Cannot be updated. In CamelCase. More info:
     https://git.k8s.io/community/contributors/devel/api-conventions.md#types-kinds
