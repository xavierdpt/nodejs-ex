KIND:     Route
VERSION:  route.openshift.io/v1

RESOURCE: tls <Object>

DESCRIPTION:
     The tls field provides the ability to configure certificates and
     termination for the route.

     TLSConfig defines config used to secure a route and provide termination

FIELDS:
   caCertificate	<string>
     caCertificate provides the cert authority certificate contents

   certificate	<string>
     certificate provides certificate contents

   destinationCACertificate	<string>
     destinationCACertificate provides the contents of the ca certificate of the
     final destination. When using reencrypt termination this file should be
     provided in order to have routers use it for health checks on the secure
     connection. If this field is not specified, the router may provide its own
     destination CA and perform hostname validation using the short service name
     (service.namespace.svc), which allows infrastructure generated certificates
     to automatically verify.

   insecureEdgeTerminationPolicy	<string>
     insecureEdgeTerminationPolicy indicates the desired behavior for insecure
     connections to a route. While each router may make its own decisions on
     which ports to expose, this is normally port 80. * Allow - traffic is sent
     to the server on the insecure port (default) * Disable - no traffic is
     allowed on the insecure port. * Redirect - clients are redirected to the
     secure port.

   key	<string>
     key provides key file contents

   termination	<string> -required-
     termination indicates termination type.
