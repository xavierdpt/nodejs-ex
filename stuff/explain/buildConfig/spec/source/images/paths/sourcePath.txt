FIELD:    sourcePath <string>

DESCRIPTION:
     sourcePath is the absolute path of the file or directory inside the image
     to copy to the build directory. If the source path ends in /. then the
     content of the directory will be copied, but the directory itself will not
     be created at the destination.
