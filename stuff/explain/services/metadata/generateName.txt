KIND:     Service
VERSION:  v1

FIELD:    generateName <string>

DESCRIPTION:
     GenerateName is an optional prefix, used by the server, to generate a
     unique name ONLY IF the Name field has not been provided. If this field is
     used, the name returned to the client will be different than the name
     passed. This value will also be combined with a unique suffix. The provided
     value has the same validation rules as the Name field, and may be truncated
     by the length of the suffix required to make the value unique on the
     server. If this field is specified and the generated name exists, the
     server will NOT return a 409 - instead, it will either return 201 Created
     or 500 with Reason ServerTimeout indicating a unique name could not be
     found in the time allotted, and the client should retry (optionally after
     the time indicated in the Retry-After header). Applied only if Name is not
     specified. More info:
