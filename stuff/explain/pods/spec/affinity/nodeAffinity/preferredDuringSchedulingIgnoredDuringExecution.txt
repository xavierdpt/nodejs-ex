KIND:     Pod
VERSION:  v1

RESOURCE: preferredDuringSchedulingIgnoredDuringExecution <[]Object>

DESCRIPTION:
     The scheduler will prefer to schedule pods to nodes that satisfy the
     affinity expressions specified by this field, but it may choose a node that
     violates one or more of the expressions. The node that is most preferred is
     the one with the greatest sum of weights, i.e. for each node that meets all
     of the scheduling requirements (resource request, requiredDuringScheduling
     affinity expressions, etc.), compute a sum by iterating through the
     elements of this field and adding "weight" to the sum if the node matches
     the corresponding matchExpressions; the node(s) with the highest sum are
     the most preferred.

     An empty preferred scheduling term matches all objects with implicit weight
     0 (i.e. it's a no-op). A null preferred scheduling term matches no objects
     (i.e. is also a no-op).

FIELDS:
   preference	<Object> -required-
     A node selector term, associated with the corresponding weight.

   weight	<integer> -required-
     Weight associated with matching the corresponding nodeSelectorTerm, in the
     range 1-100.
