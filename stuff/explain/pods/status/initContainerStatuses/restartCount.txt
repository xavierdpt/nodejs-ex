FIELD:    restartCount <integer>

DESCRIPTION:
     The number of times the container has been restarted, currently based on
     the number of dead containers that have not yet been removed. Note that
     this is calculated from dead containers. But those containers are subject
     to garbage collection. This value will get capped at 5 by GC.
