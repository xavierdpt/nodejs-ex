RESOURCE: ownerReferences <[]Object>

DESCRIPTION:
     List of objects depended by this object. If ALL objects in the list have
     been deleted, this object will be garbage collected. If this object is
     managed by a controller, then an entry in this list will point to this
     controller, with the controller field set to true. There cannot be more
     than one managing controller.

     OwnerReference contains enough information to let you identify an owning
     object. Currently, an owning object must be in the same namespace, so there
     is no namespace field.

FIELDS:
   apiVersion	<string> -required-
     API version of the referent.

   blockOwnerDeletion	<boolean>
     If true, AND if the owner has the "foregroundDeletion" finalizer, then the
     owner cannot be deleted from the key-value store until this reference is
     removed. Defaults to false. To set this field, a user needs "delete"
     permission of the owner, otherwise 422 (Unprocessable Entity) will be
     returned.

   controller	<boolean>
     If true, this reference points to the managing controller.

   kind	<string> -required-
     Kind of the referent. More info:

   name	<string> -required-
     Name of the referent. More info:

   uid	<string> -required-
