KIND:     Service
VERSION:  v1

FIELD:    type <string>

DESCRIPTION:
     type determines how the Service is exposed. Defaults to ClusterIP. Valid
     options are ExternalName, ClusterIP, NodePort, and LoadBalancer.
     "ExternalName" maps to the specified externalName. "ClusterIP" allocates a
     cluster-internal IP address for load-balancing to endpoints. Endpoints are
     determined by the selector or if that is not specified, by manual
     construction of an Endpoints object. If clusterIP is "None", no virtual IP
     is allocated and the endpoints are published as a set of endpoints rather
     than a stable IP. "NodePort" builds on ClusterIP and allocates a port on
     every node which routes to the clusterIP. "LoadBalancer" builds on NodePort
     and creates an external load-balancer (if supported in the current cloud)
     which routes to the clusterIP. More info:
