FIELD:    imageOptimizationPolicy <string>

DESCRIPTION:
     imageOptimizationPolicy describes what optimizations the system can use
     when building images to reduce the final size or time spent building the
     image. The default policy is 'None' which means the final build image will
     be equivalent to an image created by the Docker build API. The experimental
     policy 'SkipLayers' will avoid commiting new layers in between each image
     step, and will fail if the Dockerfile cannot provide compatibility with the
     'None' policy. An additional experimental policy 'SkipLayersAndWarn' is the
     same as 'SkipLayers' but simply warns if compatibility cannot be preserved.
