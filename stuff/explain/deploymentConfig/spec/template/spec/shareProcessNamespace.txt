FIELD:    shareProcessNamespace <boolean>

DESCRIPTION:
     Share a single process namespace between all of the containers in a pod.
     When this is set containers will be able to view and signal processes from
     other containers in the same pod, and the first process in each container
     will not be assigned PID 1. HostPID and ShareProcessNamespace cannot both
     be set. Optional: Default to false. This field is alpha-level and is
     honored only by servers that enable the PodShareProcessNamespace feature.
