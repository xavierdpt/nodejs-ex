KIND:     Pod
VERSION:  v1

RESOURCE: podAffinity <Object>

DESCRIPTION:
     Describes pod affinity scheduling rules (e.g. co-locate this pod in the
     same node, zone, etc. as some other pod(s)).

     Pod affinity is a group of inter pod affinity scheduling rules.

FIELDS:
   preferredDuringSchedulingIgnoredDuringExecution	<[]Object>
     The scheduler will prefer to schedule pods to nodes that satisfy the
     affinity expressions specified by this field, but it may choose a node that
     violates one or more of the expressions. The node that is most preferred is
     the one with the greatest sum of weights, i.e. for each node that meets all
     of the scheduling requirements (resource request, requiredDuringScheduling
     affinity expressions, etc.), compute a sum by iterating through the
     elements of this field and adding "weight" to the sum if the node has pods
     which matches the corresponding podAffinityTerm; the node(s) with the
     highest sum are the most preferred.

   requiredDuringSchedulingIgnoredDuringExecution	<[]Object>
     If the affinity requirements specified by this field are not met at
     scheduling time, the pod will not be scheduled onto the node. If the
     affinity requirements specified by this field cease to be met at some point
     during pod execution (e.g. due to a pod label update), the system may or
     may not try to eventually evict the pod from its node. When there are
     multiple elements, the lists of nodes corresponding to each podAffinityTerm
     are intersected, i.e. all terms must be satisfied.
