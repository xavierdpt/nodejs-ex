KIND:     BuildConfig
VERSION:  build.openshift.io/v1

FIELD:    script <string>

DESCRIPTION:
     script is a shell script to be run with `/bin/sh -ic`. It may not be
     specified with Command. Use Script when a shell script is appropriate to
     execute the post build hook, for example for running unit tests with `rake
     test`. If you need control over the image entrypoint, or if the image does
     not have `/bin/sh`, use Command and/or Args. The `-i` flag is needed to
     support CentOS and RHEL images that use Software Collections (SCL), in
     order to have the appropriate collections enabled in the shell. E.g., in
     the Ruby image, this is necessary to make `ruby`, `bundle` and other
     binaries available in the PATH.
