RESOURCE: tolerations <[]Object>

DESCRIPTION:
     If specified, the pod's tolerations.

     The pod this Toleration is attached to tolerates any taint that matches the
     triple <key,value,effect> using the matching operator <operator>.

FIELDS:
   effect	<string>
     Effect indicates the taint effect to match. Empty means match all taint
     effects. When specified, allowed values are NoSchedule, PreferNoSchedule
     and NoExecute.

   key	<string>
     Key is the taint key that the toleration applies to. Empty means match all
     taint keys. If the key is empty, operator must be Exists; this combination
     means to match all values and all keys.

   operator	<string>
     Operator represents a key's relationship to the value. Valid operators are
     Exists and Equal. Defaults to Equal. Exists is equivalent to wildcard for
     value, so that a pod can tolerate all taints of a particular category.

   tolerationSeconds	<integer>
     TolerationSeconds represents the period of time the toleration (which must
     be of effect NoExecute, otherwise this field is ignored) tolerates the
     taint. By default, it is not set, which means tolerate the taint forever
     (do not evict). Zero and negative values will be treated as 0 (evict
     immediately) by the system.

   value	<string>
     Value is the taint value the toleration matches to. If the operator is
     Exists, the value should be empty, otherwise just a regular string.
